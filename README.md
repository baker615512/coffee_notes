# Coffee Notes

This app lets the user vote on the flavor profiles of coffees from certain countries.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a place for everyone to share their experience with coffee from various places. I appreciate the nuance in flavor in single-origin coffee, and this app allows a space for a community to participate in coffee tasting.

## Tech/framework used

This app implements Rails API for the backend, React JavaScript library, Redux as the middleware, and Bootstrap for styling.

## Installation

To install this app, fork this repo in the top right corner of this page. Then, click the green Code button and the file button under the Clone tag. In your terminal, you will need to run a Rails server. You can enter `rails s` to do so. By default, the Rails server will run on localhost:3000. You will need to have Node.js already installed. If you do not, you can download it at nodejs.org. Then in your terminal, you will need to run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. Again, the default port will be 3000, which should already be running the Rails server. You will be prompted to open the app on localhost:3001, and you will choose yes.
